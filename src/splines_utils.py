# Spline model with adaptive knot vector
# We want to distribute a fixed number of points (the knots) in such a way that the firing rate changes by the same absolute amount between any two successive knots.
# In other words, the knots should be close to each other in timespans with a high absolute derivative, less dense elswhere.
#
# Mathematically this means, that given the Gauss-filtered spiketrain $\tilde s(t)$ we want to compute the function
# $D(t) = \int_0^t |\frac{d}{d \tau} \tilde s(\tau)| dt$
# (or rather, for vectors in discrete time, we want to calculate the vector
# $D[t] = \sum_0^t |\frac{d}{d \tau} \tilde s[\tau]| dt$).
#
# In programming-terms this means that for a spike vector $s$ we want to calculate the so called
# cumulative sum of the vector of absolute values of $s$ after it has been convolved with a derivative-of-Gaussian-filter.
#
# The function $D(t)$ (or the vector $D[t]$) tells us how much *absolute change* in the neuron's firing rate has accumulated until time $t$.
# The inverse of that function, $t=D^{-1}(x)$ tells us the time $t$ before which an absolute rate-change of $x$ has accumulated.
# We want to place our knots such that between each two knots the rate changes by the same absolut amount,
# i.e. we place our knots at positions $k_i = D^{-1}(\frac{i}{n}) \text{ for } i\in\{0,\dots,n\}$.
# Intuitively, that means that each of the knots has to account for the same amount of variability in the neuron's firing rate over time.
